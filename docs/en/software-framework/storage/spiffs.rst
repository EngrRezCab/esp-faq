Can SPIFFS partition be encrypted?
---------------------------------------------------------------

  :CHIP\: ESP32, ESP32S2, ESP32S3, ESP32C3:

  - No, there is no encryption scheme for SPIFFS. But, since SPIFFS is built on flash, this part of data can be encrypted via flash encryption.

-------------------

How do I store the keys and certs of ESP32 devices in SPIFFS?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  You can generate an SPIFFS image from files and flash it to the corresponding partition. See `SPIFFS Filesystem <https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/spiffs.html#spiffsgen-py>`_ for details.

--------------

Can ESP32 mount a SPIFFS file system partition in the external SPI flash？
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Yes, this function has been added in ESP-IDF v4.0 and later versions. Please note that when two partitions are mounted to ESP32, it is not permitted for multiple tasks to write files into the same partition at the same time.
