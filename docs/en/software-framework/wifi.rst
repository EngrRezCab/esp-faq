Do ESP32 and ESP8266 support Chinese SSID for Wi-Fi?
--------------------------------------------------------

  Yes, but the CODEC format of router or smart phone should be the same.

  For example, if both router and device use UTF-8 format, then the device can be successfully connected to the router with Chinese SSID.

Do Espressif's products support boundary scans?
-------------------------------------------------

  No, they don't.

--------------

What is the definition for Wi-Fi channel? Can I select any channel of my choice?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A channel refers to a specific frequency channel within the allowable range of frequencies allocated for use by Wi-Fi systems. Different countries and regions use different channel numbers. Please refer to `ESP8266 Wi-Fi Channel Selection Guidelines <https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp8266_wi-fi_channel_selection_guidelines_en.pdf>`_.

What is the default network segment for ESP8266 SoftAP?
-------------------------------------------------------------

  Why do I have problem connecting to router with IP 192.168.4.X in SoftAP + Station mode?

  - The network segment used by ESP8266 SoftAP is 192.168.4.\*, and its default IP address is 192.168.4.1. When connecting to router 192.168.4.X, errors may occur because the ESP8266 cannot distinguish if it should connect to the internal SoftAP or the external router.

--------------

How much time does an ESP32 scan take?
----------------------------------------

  The total time for scanning depends on:

  - Active scan (by default) or passive scan.
  - The time spent on each channel is 120 ms for active scanning and 360 ms for passive scanning.
  - The country code and configured channel range from 1~13 channels (by default).
  - Fast scan (by default) or full-channel scan.
  - Station mode or Station-AP mode, and if any active connections are currently maintained.

  By default, channels 1 to 11 use active scans, and channels 12 to 13 use passive scans.

  - In the absence of connection in Station mode, the total time for a full-channel scan is: 11*120 + 2*360 = 2040 ms;
  - With active connections in Station mode or Station-AP mode, the total time for a full- channel scan is: 11*120 + 2*360 + 13*30 = 2430 ms.

How can I optimize the second harmonic and other spurious signals created by my own products?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The second harmonic mainly comes from the radiation generated by the RF link and PA (power amplifier) power supply. The backplane (board size) and the product also make impact on the second harmonic. Therefore, it is recommended that you should:

  - Add a ground capacitor of approximately 2.4 pF to the RF matching circuit to reduce the spurious radiation coming from the RF link;
  - Add a series inductor to the PA power supply (Pins 3 and 4 of ESP32) to reduce the spurious radiation coming from it.

How can I suppress the harmonics of 80 MHz?
----------------------------------------------

  If the harmonics of 80 MHz (160 MHz, 240 MHz, 320 MHz, etc) exceed the allowable levels of spurious emissions, you can add a resistor of approximately 470 Ω to the data transmission circuit (TXD) to suppress those harmonics.

What is the default IP address of ESP8266 SoftAP?
------------------------------------------------------

  Why do I have problem connecting to router with IP 192.168.4.X in SoftAP + Station mode?

  Default subnet of ESP8266 SoftAP is 192.168.4.\*, and the default IP address is 192.168.4.1.

  The ESP8266 cannot distinguish if the IP address of the SoftAP and the Station are both in the same subnet, in this case, 192.168.4.x.
